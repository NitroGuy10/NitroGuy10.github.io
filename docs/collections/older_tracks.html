            <p>This is where you can download my older songs and read a bit about my story with them. I certainly feel like I have grown a lot since I have started producing. These older tracks will always have a special place in my heart but, I'll admit, their production is less-than-spectacular. I mean, seriously, I didn't do ANY sort of specific mastering on my old FL tracks. Literally JUST the default limiter. Come on.</p>

                        <p>A happy little progressive house song! This song represents the last one of mine from my "NCS-style" progressive house phase. This song had been in the workings for a LONG time. I had started it back in October of 2018 but kept having instances of writer's block. I kept trying out different melody ideas and new directions to take the song in, but nothing seemed to fit. About six months went by and I finally decided to wrap it up and only ended up having to work on it for a day before it was done!</p>

                        <p>Just a silly cover of Gangplank Galleon from Donkey Kong Country. The soundtrack of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy is simply immaculate. I have tons of respect for David Wise for his amazing work on the soundtrack of those games. This cover, however, is short, uninspired, and rather simplistic but hey, it was still a blast to make and even more of a blast to sample the timeless DK Rap from Donkey Kong 64. I dedicate this song to Noah and Izzy.</p>

                        <p>I'm not really that into hardstyle but I got my hands on a hardstyle kick sample and decided to try it out. I didn't try very hard to adhere to the typical characteristics hardstyle (nor do I really know what they are lol) but I think the final product ended up sounding pretty fun.</p>

                        <p>A wonderfully happy future bass tune with a name that I literally came up with the day I released it because I needed a better title than "Silly Koala", which was what a random name generator thought would be a suitable title. As always, a juicy saxophone solo is all one needs to round out a piece and the wonderful alto saxophone patch from SGM-V2.01 did the trick. Dang, I really am obsessed with putting sax solos in my music. I can't play saxophone myself but maybe I should consider learning how to...</p>

                        <p>My attempt at drum and bass. I tried a lot of new things in this song that I had never done before. I also used a whole bunch of samples from Team Fortress 2, one of my favorite games. I actually remember cranking this one out quite fast as it was summer and I wasn't doing much else... or maybe I just had an abundance of creative energy, who knows? I'll take this time to point out that I made this and Friendship with FL Studio 20 whereas the rest of the FL songs in this list were made with FL 12. For some reason, EWQLSO, the plugin I use for orchestra sounds, had some beef with FL 20 and would never render properly. Because of that, as of the time of writing this, I still use FL 12. I don't know if the issue has been resolved but I'm too used to FL 12 at the moment to update lol.</p>

                        <p>This is one of many of my songs where I take a small snippet of a melody from another song and make it the main hook of a separate song. The song from which I stole the melody hasn't and probably will never be released. Not really sure what else to talk about here. This is just yet another happy, Progressive House song. I guess I can talk about the album art. My early album art looks like a two-year-old's drawing in Microsoft Paint. I seriously don't know what I was thinking. For this wave of FL songs I switched to real photos I had taken on my travels. The pic for this song is pretty cool, huh?</p>

                        <p>One of my first FL Songs that's not just a sawtooth-fest. I come up with most of my melodies purely on the pianoroll but I actually came up with this melody by doodling around on a piano (one of my favorite pastimes). I tried out a slightly less boring chord progression in this one but it's really not THAT out there. I also established my love for orchestral breakdowns in this one though I feel like this particular one drags on a bit too long.</p>

                        <p>This one sure is wacky, huh? I wanted to do something a little more minimal and out of my comfort zone and I think I achieved that. Listening to this song again after all this time, I realize that I really like the melodic structure of this song but don't really like the instrumentation lol. I had been wanting to do a VIP of this song but ultimately decided against it. Maybe one day I'll decide against my decision against it. Who knows?</p>

Some of the most creative and funky melodies I've heard have been in chiptunes made in trackers. My personal favorites are the AMIGA MOD chiptunes (presumably made in ProTracker) from the early 2000s. My favorite chiptune artists are Tempest and Reed.</p>

                        <p>Another *yawn* progressive house song with a good ol' key change at the end. WHAT? There's a sax solo in this one too? I'm not fully convinced my early songs were different at all from one another. Nah, this one was pretty fun to make. I think I started just after I finished Sawtooth</p>

                        <p>This melody has such a rich vivid history that you'll never get know the nitty gritty details of mwahahahaha! It started with a tiny snippet of Rough Waters, became a SHEET MUSIC composition for ACTUAL REAL INSTRUMENTS WOW, and was finally put to rest in an FL production. I'm not too thrilled about how this rendition turned out, though. Maybe I'll make a VIP some day.</p>

                        <p>Hurricane. Oh Hurricane. I have soooooo many memories of this song from writing it, to showing it to my music teacher, to having my friends play it in class, to having my mom force me to play it for my grandmother. This song is a journey. I was heavily inspired by the kind of music we were playing in school band at the time.</p>

                        <p>Can you even call this rock? I don't think you can, but "Rock" was the feeling I was going for when producing this song. I dunno, I still kinda like this song all this time later. Especially the piano. Also, a word of caution to MIDI composers: NEVER PUT A DRUM SOLO IN MIDI LOL.</p>

                        <p>"Rough Waters was such a dramatic and sad tune. I'd better follow it up with something happy." This was probably my thought process when making this song. What came of it was a piece of insufferably happy, unclassifiable garbage, haha.</p>

                        <p>Dramatic and orchestral with a side of weird instrument choices. Maracas? Vibraphone? Barely audible tenor sax? You betcha. This was the first track where I tried to make something orchestral and grand sounding. I keep saying orchestral because I don't know how else to describe this lol. This and The Challenge Ahead were both made for a project with some friends that never got finished, but these songs paved the way for a fun and eventful music production journey!</p>

                        <p>My fifth ever music production and the first one I ever released! Yeah... this song is absolute garbage. I have no idea what I was thinking. The way I made songs before I got FL Studio was by using Anvil Studio to compose MIDIs and them opening them up in SynthFont2 to put SGM-V2.01.sf2 on them and export them. What a weird start to one's music production career lol.</p>
