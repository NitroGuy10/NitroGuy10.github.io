I had started it back in October of 2018 but kept having instances of writer's block. I kept trying out different melody ideas and new directions to take the song in, but nothing seemed to fit. About six months went by and I finally decided to wrap it up and only ended up having to work on it for a day before it was done!",

I actually remember cranking this one out quite fast as it was summer and I wasn't doing much else... or maybe I just had an abundance of creative energy, who knows? I'll take this time to point out that I made this and Friendship with FL Studio 20 whereas the rest of the FL songs in this list were made with FL 12. For some reason, EWQLSO, the plugin I use for orchestra sounds, had some beef with FL 20 and would never render properly. Because of that, as of the time of writing this, I still use FL 12. I don't know if the issue has been resolved but I'm too used to FL 12 at the moment to update lol.",

    description: "An unbelievably joyful future bass tune with various silly samples and lot of chiptune influence. This song's production is actually quite simplistic but I think it fits the future bass style quite well and I'm super happy with the final product. The name of this song and the EP was actually a suggestion from a friend for the name of my track Sunshine. I really loved that name but I felt that I could make another song that would match the mood of the title better in the future... and here we are!",

I got myself some new samples, new plugins (namely Serum), and I finally figured out that the default Fruity Limiter settings alone may not be the best for mastering lol.",

    description: "A somber but powerful melodic dubstep tune. This is another one of those songs that went through a MASSIVE rework to get to where it is now. This particular one was in 4/4, in the key of C minor, and was going to have a normie progressive house drop. When I was itching to try making dubstep, I decided to flip this song and I'm so happy I did! Also, huge thanks to my buddy Vishnu for the sax solo!",
